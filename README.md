# Hi, I'm Jahnavi 👋

Electronics & Communication Engineering student  
Focused on **embedded systems, firmware, and signal processing**

I build **systems**, not demos — prioritizing correctness, architecture, and understanding over convenience.

**Distributed, event-driven embedded system**

- Multiple MCUs + SBCs (Arduino, Pico, Pi, Odroid)
- Time synchronization & arbitration
- Fault detection & recovery
- Central logging & observability

> A system-level project focused on coordination, timing, and failure modes — not individual sensors.

## 📈 What I Optimize For

- Engineering depth over surface features
- Deterministic behavior over convenience
- Documentation that explains *why*, not just *what*
- Systems thinking over isolated components
